#Chicken Game 
## A working title

###Concept
A chicken farming simulation. The player feeds, waters, and protects the chickens, building and repairing fences, shoo-ing foxes and ferrets.

The players collects eggs, sells eggs, and buys better (organic) feed and (durable) fences. The price of the eggs goes up. Eventually the player buys more hens and balances the health and wellbeing of the chickens with profit.

**Unsolved Problems with this Concept:** 

The concept is similar to Lemonade Tycoon which takes a few hours to finish and ends with you managing a lemonade empire in a stadium. That is way too big. 

I see this a cute little which game you could finish in about 10 minutes, maybe 3 levels... but _how can I avoid an anticlimactic finish ?_

###Progress
**Done:**

1. The player entity walks and responds to arrow keys.
2. The chicken entities walk and randomly change direction.

**Next Up:**

1. Re-Design player
2. Fix the issue where the chickens get stuck
3. Design loading screen, background.
4. Chickens lay eggs, player collects eggs, sells eggs, gets points and coins.
